## How to use

Note: Open Notion only works if you have the desktop app installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.notion.so/desktop).

1. Open `Open Notion.app`

2. Copy a Notion URL to your clipboard. You can get this in the share dialogue or by copying it directly from the browser.
Example: `https://wwww.notion.so/notion-page`

3. Click `Open in Notion Desktop App` from the dropdown in the menubar or use the keyboard shortcut `control+option+command+n`

4. Voila! The link you just copied should now open in the Desktop App
